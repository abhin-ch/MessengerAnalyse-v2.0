# How does it work?

From your Facebook, download you messenger data. It will take a few days, but the results will be interesting. After downloading you will have a collection of threads or conversations as .json. Upload any number of those files into our app and watch the magic happen. We can download our facebook data in 5 easy steps

* 1: Go to Facebook, and click the dropdown on the Top Right. Then to go Settings & Privacy

* You can of course download much more, but what we're looking at is Messages

Just remember to download your information as JSON. Its up to you what media quality is, the higher the more memeory is needed to store on your computer. For our project, we selected the Low for convience.

# Why ?

To learn new skills of course! During the time of this project we learned not only new tools, algorithms, and software (it was quite a bit) but also how to work together. Collaboration is a very important skill that is lacking in practice for academics, so we took it upon ourselves to learn how to work together learn from each other. Not only did we learn to work together but now we have a project that demonstrates as such.
